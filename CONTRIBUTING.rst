Althought this is a toy project, I do accept contributions of any kind (except for money or job offers):

You can test it and open issues,

You can fork and propose via Pull Requests,

You can write any kind of documentation,

You will have to use any licence compatible with "BSD 2 clauses" licence.

I may take a day or two to respond.
