Contributing
============


Althought this is a toy project, I do accept contributions of any kind (except money and job offers):

* You can test and open issues,

* You can fork and propose your modifications via Pull Requests,

* You can also write any kind of documentation,

* You will have to use any licence compatible with "BSD 2 clauses" licence.

I may take a few days to respond.
