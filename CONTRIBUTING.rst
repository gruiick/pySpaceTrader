Contributing
============


Althought this is a toy project, I do accept contributions of any kind (except money and job offers):

* You can play and test, and open issues,

* You can fork and propose your modifications via Pull Requests (PR),

* You can also write any kind of documentation,

* You will have to use any licence compatible with "BSD 2 clauses" licence for your contributions.

I may take a few days to respond.

I have a very simple workflow:

* developpement goes in 'develop' branch,

* once stable, or considered unharmfull, merge to default,

* default should be always stable (and playable).
