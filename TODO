* update_stocks() within next_turn()
    - update_shipyard() with progressive completion

* Bank tab
    * ? credit (pour rembourser le ship) ?
    crédit = loan (+compute interests every turn)

* Universe as an object? <- a list is OK for now
    which turn are we? (in case of saved game)
        where to save it? universe or captain?
    ease save/load ? (only one object to deal with?)
    (re)compute prices & stocks on planets each turn

* Shipyard tab
    only on Industrial to Hi-tech level [5-7]   -> OK
    display Planet.Shipyard(), which contain Ship()  -> OK
    show available ships, caracteristics and prices  -> OK
    buy/replace current ship
    transfert elements to new ship

* News tab (3 frames)
    - show local news (plague, war, etc)
    - show available mercenary (for hiring)
    - show Galactic News (for quests, bounty, etc.)

* Skills management (with status)

* Mercenary (hire, pay, use skills)

* a lot of simple errors need to be taken care of -> display something instead of rage-quit :o)
    * no game open
    * open, cancel
    * load, cancel
    * etc.


Later:
======
    * vaisseaux (position(s), type: traders, smugglers, pirates, SpacePolice),
    * interactions within "next turn" -> meets, trades, combats and controls
    * quêtes (tribbles!)

    * tribbles will reproduce a lot, filling empty cargo pod, eating (emptying) food, medecine, narcotics, even furs, if there is nothing else. They are a plague. The only ways to get rid of it are to sell the ship, or destroy it in a space fight.


Done:
=====

* Bank tab
    * transactions log -> OK
    * display transactions log -> OK
    * incomes (profits) vs expenses (fuel)  -> OK
    * invoices ? (goods, qty, price) -> profit/loss ? <- detailed?
        warning: in case of illegal goods, you don't want StarPolice to find
        your detailed invoices -> it's part of the game, they will charge you with felony

* Captain Board
    -> different from bank account (See Bank Tab)
solde = balance (+gain, -loss)
cash != balance
achat = purchase, buy -> cargo qty, cargo value
vente = sale, sell (vendre)
